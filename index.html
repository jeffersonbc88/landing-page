                <p><b>Aerosmith</b> is an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. The group consists of Steven
                    Tyler
                    (lead vocals, harmonica, piano), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums), and
                    Brad
                    Whitford (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also incorporated
                    elements
                    of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock
                    artists. </p>

            <h2>Top 3 Jobs</h2>
            <p>In 1964, Steven Tyler formed his own band called the Strangeurs—later Chain Reaction—in Yonkers, New
                York. Meanwhile, Perry and Hamilton formed the Jam Band (commonly known as "Joe Perry's Jam Band"),
                which was based on free-form and blues. Hamilton and Perry moved to Boston, Massachusetts in September
                1969. There they met Joey Kramer, a drummer from Yonkers, New York. Kramer knew Tyler and had always
                hoped to play in a band with him. Kramer, a Berklee College of Music student, decided to leave the
                school, and joined Jam Band.</p>
            <p>In 1970, Chain Reaction and Jam Band played at the same gig. Tyler immediately loved Jam Band's sound,
                and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the
                proposition. Tyler, who had been a drummer and backup singer in Chain Reaction, adamantly refused to
                play drums in this new band, insisting that he would take part only if he could be frontman and lead
                vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was formed. The band moved into a home together at 1325
                Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between
                shows.</p>
            <p>The members of the band reportedly spent afternoons getting high and watching Three Stooges reruns. One
                day, they had a post-Stooges meeting to try to come up with a name. Kramer said that, when he was in
                school, he would write the word "aerosmith" all over his notebooks. The name had popped into his head
                after listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet, which featured jacket art of a circus performer
                jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought he was
                referring to the Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. "No, not
                Arrowsmith," Kramer explained. "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith." The band settled upon this name after also
                considering "the Hookers" and "Spike Jones." At some point prior to the weekend of December 25, 1971,
                they were known as "Fox Chase."</p>
